Due to cross origin request, you must run chrome unsecured in order to pull data from the api for the "Crypto Monitoring" page.

Search and open "Run" on windows. 
Copy and paste: "chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security" Run.
now you are able to see data populate for crypto monitoring page.

In case there's any issues with displaying the html page. Please make sure to extract the zip folder that was downloaded from Github in order to have it properly working.

Thank you!!
